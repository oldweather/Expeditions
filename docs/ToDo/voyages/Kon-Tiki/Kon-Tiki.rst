Kon-Tiki Expedition (1947)
==========================

.. warning::

   This expedition is not yet released.

The `Kon-Tiki Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_expedition>`_, led by `Thor Heyerdahl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl>`_, was a raft voyage across the South Pacific from Callao in Peru to the Tuamoto Archipelago.

Regular weather observations were made by `Herman Watzinger <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Watzinger>`_. The meteorological log has been preserved by the `Kon-Tiki Museum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_Museum>`_.

We might be able to get more observations from this voyage - it's :doc:`likely the met. log does not contain everything <metadata>`, but there is not much point: Because the voyage is in the tropics, where weather varibility is small, and the agreement between observations and 20CR is pretty good (see Analyses, below); in spite of the shortage of nearby observations, we'd need a lot of very precise observations to make a substantial improvement in the current datasets, and the Kon-Tiki's observations are not that precise.
