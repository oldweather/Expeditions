How to use this dataset
=======================

Unless you have a very specialist requirement, don't download this dataset just to get the observations, get them from `ICOADS release 3 <https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds548.0/>`_ instead.

Do download this dataset to add more expeditions - there is a `ToDo section <https://github.com/oldweather/Expeditions/tree/master/ToDo>`_ with some that are ready for conversion.

This document is kept under version control in a `git repository <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_. The repository is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (and the documentation made with `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_). The repository is `<https://github.com/oldweather/Expeditions>`_. 

If you are familiar with GitHub, you already know `what to do <https://github.com/oldweather/Expeditions>`_: If you'd prefer not to bother with that, you can download the whole dataset as `a zip file <https://github.com/oldweather/Expeditions/archive/master.zip>`_.

The scripts in this package depend on `the IMMA toolkit <https://github.com/oldweather/IMMA>`_ which provides both support for the `IMMA data format <http://icoads.noaa.gov/e-doc/imma/>`_ and an implementation of the `lmrlib <http://icoads.noaa.gov/software/lmrlib>`_ data conversion functions.
