How to use this dataset
=======================

This dataset is kept under version control in a `git repository <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_. The repository is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (and the documentation made with `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_). The repository is `<https://github.com/philip-brohan/OCR-weatherrescue>`_.

If you are familiar with GitHub, you already know `what to do <https://github.com/philip-brohan/OCR-weatherrescue>`_: If you'd prefer not to bother with that, you can download the whole dataset as `a zip file <https://github.com/philip-brohan/OCR-weatherrescue/archive/master.zip>`_.

The dataset is in two parts: A set of 81 document images - each a photograph of a table of numbers; and a set of 81 CSV files - containing those same numbers in computer-readable format. The challenge is to write software that converts the former to the latter. 

If you try this, please let us know, by `raising an issue <https://github.com/philip-brohan/OCR-weatherrescue/issues/new>`_. You are not obliged to do this, but it would help.
