Uses of this data
=================

All the expeditions, Except Alligator and Boussole, which were added most recently, are included in `ICOADS release 3 <https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds548.0/>`_. (Though the observations included are not exactly the same - ICOADS applies some of its own data filtering and quality control.)

All the expeditions (including Alligator and Boussole) are included in `the ICOADS3+ dataset <https://github.com/oldweather/ICOADS3.plus>`_ and so in the forthcoming version 3 of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis.
