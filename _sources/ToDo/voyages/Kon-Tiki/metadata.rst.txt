Kon-Tiki Expedition (1947): Metadata
====================================

There is no infomation in the Met Log on the nature or use of the weather instruments, but we can glean some information from the published accounts of the voyage:

It is likely there are more weather observations than those in the Met Log: Barograph traces, more precise wind speeds, and more than two observations/day (Heyerdahl's `The Kon-Tiki Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kon-Tiki_Expedition:_By_Raft_Across_the_South_Seas>`_). The same source states that observations were sent, by radio, to the Weather Bureau in Washington twice a day - the Met Log might well contain these radioed observations. (It's not clear what the Weather Bureau did with the observations they received).

Air Temperature
---------------

I can find no indication of how the air temperature observations were made. I found no sign of a stevenson-type screen in any published photograph or illustration.

Sea Temperature
---------------

I can find no indication of how the sea temperature observations were made. Kon-Tiki is almost unique in that it would have been easy just to stick a thermometer into the surrounding ocean, and this may well have been done.

Air Pressure
------------

I can find no mention of a barometer in any of the voyage accounts. But managing a mercury barometer on the raft would not have been easy, and an illustration in Hesselberg's `Kon-Tiki and I <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kon-Tiki-I-Erik-Hesselberg/dp/B0000CHSKA>`_ shows an instrument which could be a barograph. So I'm assuming the pressures are from an aneroid barometer.

Wind
----

Wind observations were made using a hand-held annemometer - see illustration in Hesselberg's `Kon-Tiki and I <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kon-Tiki-I-Erik-Hesselberg/dp/B0000CHSKA>`_, also there's a photo in Heyerdahl's `The Kon-Tiki Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kon-Tiki_Expedition:_By_Raft_Across_the_South_Seas>`_.

Heyerdahl's book also indicates that observations were made at the masthead (at a guess, 6m above sea-level?), and several times a day.

It's notable that the wind observations in the Met Log are in Beaufort Force - possibly they were transformed for radio transmission.
