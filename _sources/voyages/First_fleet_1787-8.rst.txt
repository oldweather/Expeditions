The First Fleet (1787-8)
========================

The `First Fleet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet>`_ sailed from England in 1787 to found a penal colony in Australia. One of the officers of the fleet, `William Bradley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradley_(Royal_Navy_officer)>`_, on `HMS Sirius <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sirius_(1786)>`_, took regular weather observations on the voyage and recorded them in his journal.

The State library of New South Wales have `the Manuscript of Bradley's journal <http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314966>`_.

These observations were published as `The weather of the First Fleet voyage to Botany Bay, 1787â€“1788, Gergis et al., 2010, <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wea.608>`_
