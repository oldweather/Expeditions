William Scoresby (1807-1822)
============================

The remarkable `William Scoresby <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Scoresby>`_ spent 15 summers in the Greenland Sea, hunting whales. He reported his weather observations in two books:

* `An Account of the Arctic Regions: With a History and Description of the Northern Whale-fishery, Volume 2 <https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_BoFAAAAMAAJ>`_
* `Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale-Fishery <https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N8xV7OSqrCgC>`_

He did make pressure measurements, but unfortunately only reported the daily means, so we can't use them.

He wrote to the Royal Society in 1817, saying that there was much less ice in the sea than usual that year. This was a trigger for the Royal Navy expeditions starting in 1818.
