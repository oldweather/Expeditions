HMS Hecla (1819-1820)
=====================

`William Parry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parry_(explorer)>`_ did not believe in the `Croker Mountains <https://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/northwest-passage/croker-mountains.htm>`_ which had stopped :doc:`John Ross <Isabella_1818>`. So the following year he led another NorthWest Passage Expedition. Parry was in command of `HMS Hecla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hecla_(1815)>`_, supported by `HMS Griper <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Griper_(1813)>`_ under Matthew Liddon. The mountains were indeed illusory, and this expedition got much further into Lancaster sound.

The reported their observations in `Journal of a Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific: Performed in the Years 1819-20 ... <https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdM0AAAAQAAJ>`_. We also have some of the Hecla's logbooks, `in the National Archives ADM55 collection <http://archive.ceda.ac.uk/corral/adm55/adm55_index.html>`_.
